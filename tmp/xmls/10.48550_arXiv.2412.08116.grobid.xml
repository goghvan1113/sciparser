<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Oil spills, caused by offshore drilling, shipping accidents, and natural seepage, lead to the release of vast amounts of oil into oceans, posing severe, often irreversible threats to marine ecosystems and coastal economies. This requires early detection and accurate damage assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) stands out among remote sensing modalities, as it acquires data in all weather and light- ing conditions by emitting microwave signals and measuring the reflected backscatter from the Earth's surface <ref type="bibr">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr">21,</ref><ref type="bibr">35,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref>. So, the analysis of SAR imagery is essential for the detection and estimation of oil spill areas in the ocean. Additionally, oil spills result in reduced surface roughness, causing the affected areas to appear as dark spots in SAR images <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63]</ref>. By detecting these dark regions, SAR-based methods can accurately identify and delineate the extent of an oil spill <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56]</ref>.</p><p>However, a major challenge in SAR-based oil spill segmentation is in two folds: (i) The lack of oil spill data and their precise labels -SAR oil spill data is limited due to the rarity of oil spill events and the complexity of label annotation; (ii) The inherent speckle noise in SAR images -this is caused from random interference among elementary reflectors, which obscures essential features and complicates the differentiation between targets and background <ref type="bibr">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64]</ref>.</p><p>These limitations underscore the difficulties of applying traditional segmentation models to SAR imagery, especially for oil spill detection.</p><p>In this paper, to tackle the scarcity of labeled SAR oil spill data, we firstly propose a diffusion-based Data Augmentation and Knowledge Distillation (DAKD) technique for oil spill segmentation. The success of generative models, particularly diffusion models <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, has led to their increasing use in data augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">36,</ref><ref type="bibr">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68,</ref><ref type="bibr">69]</ref>. Here, we further extend the capability of diffusion models to knowledge distillation by generating SAR images and logit values for the corresponding labels for knowledge distillation. To achieve this, we propose a SAR-JointNet which jointly models the distribution of SAR images and segmentation maps by accounting for different information retainment in the diffusion process across modalities. Also, to faithfully produce pixel-wise class probabilities (soft label) with rich information from logits, the label generation is optimized using a cross-entropy loss. By leveraging the augmented data with soft labels from the SAR-JointNet, our teacher model, we can induce robust training for the student network, called SAR Oil Spill Segmentation Network (SAROSS-Net). Compared to one-hot encoded hard labels, these soft labels, containing richer probability information for each class, allow SAROSS-Net to learn more effectively and improve segmentation performance.</p><p>Unlike natural images, SAR imagery contains excessively abundant high-frequency noise, making selective feature extraction among noisy features critical for precise segmentation. To address this, we introduce Context-Aware Feature Transfer (CAFT) blocks in the skip connections to selectively transfer the encoded features from the MambaVision encoder <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> to the decoder for our SAROSS-Net. Our CAFT block facilitates effective referencing of semantic features to prioritize essential high-frequency features, enhancing the segmentation accuracy under noisy conditions. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates our DAKD pipeline. Our SAR-JointNet is trained to generate SAR images and their corresponding logits for segmentation using the original training dataset D. After training, our SAR-JointNet synthesizes an augmented dataset D a including the SAR images and their logits. Leveraging both D and D a , we train our proposed SAROSS-Net with knowledge distillation from SAR-JointNet. Our SAROSS-Net trained with the DAKD pipeline demonstrates superior performance on the SAR oil spill datasets <ref type="bibr">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr">81]</ref>, achieving notable improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to previous approaches. Our contributions are summarized as follows:</p><p>• To the best of our knowledge, we firstly propose a Data Augmentation and Knowledge Distillation (DAKD) pipeline, which leverages a diffusion-based teacher model trained for data generation to augment data (DA) and enables knowledge distillation to a student model (KD).</p><p>• By leveraging SAR-JointNet that can effectively learn the joint distribution of the SAR images and segmentation mask for data augmentation, we handle the data scarcity in SAR 'oil-spill' segmentation. • We introduce a SAR oil-spill segmentation network, SAROSS-Net, with Context-Aware Feature Transfer (CAFT) blocks in skip connections, to selectively transfer high-frequency features from noisy SAR images to the decoder blocks for better segmentation accuracy. • Our pipeline significantly outperforms existing state-ofthe-art methods on the SAR oil spill detection dataset <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref> and the SOS dataset [81]. However, these models still struggle to handle remote sensing modalities like SAR imagery <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>In remote sensing, deep learning-based semantic segmentation models have also been studied for satellite Electro-Optical and SAR images <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[80]</ref>. Specifically, for SAR oil spill segmentation, various models such as U-Net, LinkNet, and Deeplab are widely used <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">37,</ref><ref type="bibr">81]</ref>. Krestenitis et al. <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref> utilized Deeplabv3+ [11] model on the oil spill detection dataset consisting of five classes such as 'land', 'sea-surface', 'ship', 'look-alike' and 'oil spill'. In addition, <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al. [81]</ref> proposed a SAR oil spill (SOS) dataset and a new architecture, CBD-Net. More recently, SAM-OIL <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> proposed a two-stage approach: first detecting oil spills with a YOLOv8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> network, then applying large-scale SAM [34] inference based on bounding boxes predicted from the first stage. However, the scarcity of publicly available oil spill data continues to hinder the development and generalization of these methods, limiting their robustness across different real-world scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data Augmentation with Diffusion Models</head><p>Data augmentation increases the diversity and amount of data in situations with limited data to improve the performance of several tasks. Recent studies utilize the power of diffusion models to generate diverse images and corresponding label pairs for data augmentation. For image clas-sification, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61</ref>] used text as both the class label and the condition, generating image-class label pairs and improved performance. In image captioning, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> addressed limited artistic data by generating image-caption pairs. Object detection benefits from models like <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">23]</ref>, which generate images based on bounding boxes, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref> creates image-bounding box pairs jointly from diffusion features. For semantic segmentation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref> generates image-scribble pairs to enhance scribble-supervised segmentation, while [69] generates medical image-segmentation mask pairs using masks as conditions. For remote sensing images, Sat-Synth <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref> jointly synthesizes Electro-optical images and corresponding segmentation masks by simply using concatenated images and labels as inputs of a diffusion model.</p><p>Our diffusion-based SAR-JointNet synthesizes SAR images and segmentation masks to address the scarcity of labeled SAR oil spill data. In the training of the diffusionbased joint generation of images and labels, balancing the differences between modalities is critical for downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation. Our SAR-JointNet introduces a balancing factor to effectively model the joint distribution of SAR images and segmentation masks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Knowledge Distillation</head><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a prominent technique for transferring information from a larger or more complex model (teacher model) to a smaller and simpler model (student model). Initially introduced by Hinton et al.</p><p>[30], KD allows the student model to learn from the softened output predictions of the teacher, capturing both the correct class and the relative probabilities of other classes, which are often useful for learning generalizable features. KD has been actively studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr">74]</ref> and useful across a variety of computer vision tasks <ref type="bibr">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65,</ref><ref type="bibr">71]</ref>.</p><p>KD has also been studied to address data dependency during the training of neural networks. The data-free knowledge distillation approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">46]</ref> enable knowledge transfer from teachers to student models by generating synthetic data that mimic the training distribution, even when the original dataset is unavailable due to privacy concerns. Recently, diffusion-based distillation techniques leverage pretrained large-scale 2D diffusion models to transfer knowledge to new tasks such as 3D novel view synthesis <ref type="bibr">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr">50]</ref>. In addition, DiffKD <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is proposed to align denoised student features to teacher features, enhancing the performance of image classification and semantic segmentation. In our proposed Data Augmentation and Knowledge Distillation (DAKD) pipeline, our diffusionbased SAR-JointNet not only learns to generate realistic SAR images and their corresponding labels that mimic the training data distribution but also provides logit values containing the teacher's knowledge. This allows the student model to effectively learn from the augmented data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">DAKD Pipeline</head><p>Our Data Augmentation and Knowledge Distillation (DAKD) framework to effectively handle the scarcity of labeled data for SAR oil spill segmentation is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Our DAKD pipeline consists of two stages.</p><p>In the first stage of the DAKD pipeline, our SAR-JointNet is trained to generate an augmented dataset, D a , including SAR images along with their corresponding logits. Unlike one-hot segmentation maps (hard labels), logits (soft labels) provide probabilistic information that contains class predictions of our SAR-JointNet. This richer supervision can offer stable learning for the student model by leveraging pixel-level certainty, which helps accurate segmentation and strengthens the model's generalization during training. Our SAR-JointNet is trained to ensure that the generated SAR images and labels closely resemble the original data distribution, allowing them to effectively supplement the existing dataset.</p><p>In the second stage, our SAROSS-Net, a SAR oil spill segmentation network, is trained using the combination of the original training dataset (D) and the augmented dataset (D a ) synthesized by our SAR-JointNet. From a knowledge distillation perspective, the synthesized soft labels in D a offer improved training stability and guide robust segmentation learning, compared to hard labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">SAR-JointNet</head><p>Our SAR-JointNet takes advantage of the JointNet [72] that diffuses two modalities into their respective networks: (i) The usage of separate networks for two modalities (SAR images and segmentation masks in our case) enables the utilization of one single modality (SAR images only) to improve its generation ability even when the labels (segmentation masks) are unavailable; (ii) By making the two networks focus on their own modalities, they can be specialized in learning the unique features of their own. Therefore, in our SAR-JointNet, we implemented two networks: SAR-Net for SAR image generation and Label-Net for the corresponding logit generation. SAR-Net and Label-Net interact with each other to exchange their essential features across different modalities, enabling cross-modality reinforcement and well-aligned SAR and logit pair generation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the overall architecture of SAR-JointNet consisting of SAR-Net and Label-Net.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Balancing Diffusion between Two Modalities</head><p>Diffusion-based joint generation of the natural images and their pixel-wise labels has been explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr">72]</ref>, but the different characteristics across modalities are overlooked. In generating noisy SAR images x and segmentation masks y simultaneously, the information level in each modality can vary significantly. Therefore, balancing the retained information level between the two modalities is essential for stable training. To address this issue, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">14]</ref> applied a predefined scale factor to the images in the diffusion process to adjust the information level of noise corrupted images between different image resolutions or modalities.</p><p>We extend this approach by introducing a balancing factor b based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For input SAR x 0 ∈ R H×W ×1 and the normalized segmentation masks y 0 ∈ {-1, 1} H×W ×C where C is the number of classes, b is multiplied to y 0 , to control information levels between x t and y t , expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y ′ 0 = by 0 .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Using x 0 and y ′ 0 ∈ {-b, b} H×W ×C , forward diffusion process at timestep t is expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x t = α t x 0 + σ t ϵ, y ′ t = α t y ′ 0 + σ t ϵ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where α t and σ t are the degrees of signals and noise, respectively. The SNR of x t and y ′ t are formulated as follows: SNR(x t ) = P(α t x 0 )/P(σ t ϵ)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= α 2 t P(x 0 )/σ 2 t P(ϵ), SNR(y ′ t ) = α 2 t b 2 P(y 0 )/σ 2 t P(ϵ) = b 2 SNR(y t ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where P(•) denotes the mean power of frequency components, obtained from the 2D discrete FT. The balancing factor b that matches SNR(x t ) to SNR(y ′ t ) is defined as: b = SNR(x t )/ SNR(y t ) = P(x 0 )/ P(y 0 ).</p><p>(4)</p><p>In our experiments, we calculate b by averaging the mean power of the frequency component from the entire training dataset, which is shared across whole training samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Training Strategy of SAR-JointNet</head><p>Our SAR-JointNet leverages a three-stage training strategy, to progressively enhance the capability of SAR images and their labels (segmentation masks). In Stage 1 of training, SAR-Net θ is trained to denoise the noise-corrupted SAR image x t by minimizing L x between the original SAR image x 0 and the denoised SAR image xθ , expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L x = E x0 ∥x 0 -xθ ∥ 2 2 . (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>In Stage 2 of training, Label-Net ϕ is initialized with the pretrained weights of SAR-Net from Stage 1, while the input and output layers are reinitialized to match the channel number of the labels. To enhance label generation capability, SAR-Net is frozen except for the layers interacting with Label-Net such as zero-convolution layers. To guide Label-Net training, we employ a cross-entropy (CE) loss that has been demonstrated to be effective for accurate label generation in prior work <ref type="bibr">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14]</ref>. Label-Net learns to generate logits (pixel-wise probability map) ŷϕ , by minimizing L y , defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L y = - 1 N N j=1 C i=1 ỹ0 (i, j) log(ŷ ϕ (i, j)),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where N = H × W and ỹ0 ∈ {0, 1} H×W ×C denotes the one-hot encoded segmentation mask, while SAR-Net is trained by minimizing L x . The combined loss L joint for SAR-JointNet training is formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L joint = L x + L y . (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>In Stage 3, all layers of our SAR-JointNet are finetuned with a reduced learning rate by minimizing L joint in Eq. 7. After training, our SAR-JointNet jointly synthesizes realistic SAR images and their logit values for our DAKD pipeline, with the label inference process following the approach of Chen et al. [14].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">SAR Oil Spill Segmentation Network</head><p>By leveraging the proposed DAKD pipeline, our SAR-JointNet transfers knowledge to our proposed SAR oil spill segmentation network (SAROSS-Net). Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> illustrates the architecture of our SAROSS-Net based on a MambaVision [28] encoder. A key to achieving accurate segmentation from noisy SAR oil spill images is to filter out noise features while retaining the features for segmentation boundaries. We introduce Context-Aware Feature Transfer (CAFT) blocks to selectively transfer high-frequency features from encoded features to decoder blocks. Along UNet++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[76]</ref> architecture-based skip-connection, each CAFT block transfers high-resolution (HR) features to the next CAFT block or the convolutional decoder block, by referring to the lower-resolution (LR) features. </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">� 𝑯𝑯 × � 𝑾𝑾 × � 𝑪𝑪 � 𝑯𝑯 𝟐𝟐 × � 𝑾𝑾 𝟐𝟐 × � 𝑪𝑪 � 𝑪𝑪 × � 𝑯𝑯� 𝑾𝑾 � 𝑯𝑯� 𝑾𝑾 × � 𝑪𝑪 � 𝑯𝑯� 𝑾𝑾 × � 𝑪𝑪 � 𝑯𝑯� 𝑾𝑾 × � 𝑪𝑪 𝑸𝑸 𝑻𝑻 Trans- pose ⊕ C C C C � 𝑯𝑯 × � 𝑾𝑾 × � 𝑪𝑪 × 𝟒𝟒 CD CD CD ×2 ×2 ×2 Figure 3</formula><p>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Context-Aware Feature Transfer Block</head><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, our proposed Context-Aware Feature Transfer (CAFT) block leverages the core principles of cross-attention, where LR feature maps contain semantic information as the Query, while HR feature maps as the Key and Value. This allows the CAFT block to effectively transfer only essential high-frequency spatial details from noisy SAR images guided by the abstract semantics from LR features. For the CAFT block, we adopt transposed-attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref> to reduce the computational and memory burdens of the conventional attention mechanism <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref>. By constructing the attention map in the channel dimension, the transposedattention lowers the complexity from O(H 2 W 2 ) to O(C 2 ), where H × W denotes the spatial resolution and C is the number of channels in the feature map. In our CAFT block, we use (i) the upsampled low-resolution features F LR as Query features containing global semantic information, and (ii) the HR features F HR as both Key and Value, capturing finer spatial details essential for precise segmentation. This enables the CAFT block to effectively integrate high-level semantics with detailed spatial information, enhancing the overall performance of the segmentation task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Loss Functions for Training SAROSS-Net</head><p>To leverage the augmented SAR images and corresponding logits (ŷ ϕ ) from SAR-JointNet, we employ a knowledge distillation loss <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref> to transfer knowledge to our SAROSS-Net.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Data Generation Results from SAR-JointNet</head><p>We compare the generation qualities of SAR images and segmentation masks generated by our SAR-JointNet against other diffusion models, DDPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and JointNet <ref type="bibr">[72]</ref>. For training DDPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, we adopt the methodology from Sat-Synth <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref>, where SAR images and segmentation masks are simply concatenated as input. Our baseline model, JointNet</p><p>[72], is trained without utilizing the balancing factor b and the cross entropy loss for label generation, making it a direct comparison point to highlight the improvements introduced by our approach. In Tab. 1, we compare the qualities of generated SAR images by measuring the Frechet inception distance (FID) and the inception score (IS) between SAR images from the original training datasets and augmented SAR images. For this analysis, we use 4, 480 SAR images from the OSD dataset <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref> and 3, 200 from the SOS dataset [81]. Our SAR-JointNet achieves superior results in all metrics, especially with significantly large margins of 18.78 (38%) and 15.82 (32%) improvements in FID, compared to DDPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and JoinNet [72], respectively, for the OSD dataset <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the generated SAR images and their corresponding segmentation masks (labels). In the first row, we compare generated SAR image and label pairs, containing 'oil-spill' and 'ship' class information. DDPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> misclassified the ship class with irrelevant land information, and JointNet [72] mismatched ship shapes. In contrast, our SAR-JointNet generates bright and star-shaped ships with precise segmentation mask alignment, closely matching the original training dataset. In the second row, DDPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> synthesizes unclear boundaries for the land, and JointNet [72] yields labels to include 'look-alike' (small-sized isolated red area) in the land region (green region).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">SAR Oil Spill Segmentation Network</head><p>Ablation studies were performed to show the effect of key components in our approach. First, we demonstrate the effect of employing the CE loss and the balancing factor b in Tab. 4 for training SAR-JointNet. With CE loss, SAR-JointNet provides soft label information that contains richer information than hard labels, yielding better segmentation performance in both mIoU and F1 scores, compared to the baseline model without CE loss. The balancing factor b effectively adjusts the information levels of masks with respect to their corresponding SAR images, leading to a significant improvement in both FID and IS for the generated SAR images, compared to the baseline. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, the noise-corrupted segmentation masks scaled with the balancing factor maintain similar levels of information with the corresponding SAR image across all timesteps t. Especially at t = 0.9, the noise-corrupted segmentation mask without applying the balancing factor still contains the overall location of the oil spill, which can predefine the shape of the SAR image, potentially limiting the learning of joint distribution. Our SAR-JointNet, with both components applied, generates realistic SAR images and segmentation masks with strong correspondences, making it suitable for train- Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.

As shown, simply incorporating CAFT blocks into skip connections improves performance for both encoders. Specifically, the mIoU increases by 1.78% and 1.39% for the ResNet-34 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and the MambaVision-B [28] encoders respectively, indicating that our CAFT blocks effectively handle encoded features from noisy SAR images, regardless of the encoder. Next, we compare the effect of the label type generated from our SAR-JointNet for segmentation. One-hot encoded segmentation masks (hard labels) improve the segmentation performance of both models due to the increased training data. The usage of logit values (soft labels) generated by our SAR-JointNet further improves the performance, as the logits carry richer information for transferring knowledge to student models. These results demonstrate that our DAKD pipeline effectively augments the dataset and enhances the generalizability of student models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, a novel DAKD pipeline was introduced to enhance SAR image-based oil spill segmentation performance by addressing data scarcity and limited label availability. Our diffusion-based SAR-JointNet jointly generates image-label pairs efficiently with the introduction of a balancing factor, which ensures that information levels across modalities are effectively harmonized during the diffusion process. Additionally, we not only used image-label pairs from the SAR-JointNet for data augmentation but also firstly incorporated knowledge distillation. Logit-based labels generated by SAR-JointNet enable effective knowledge transfer to the segmentation model, SAROSS-Net. Lastly, we proposed the SAROSS-Net using Context-Aware Feature Transfer blocks, enabling robust segmentation even in SAR images with inherent speckle noises. Through this approach, we achieved state-of-the-art performance in SAR oil spill segmentation with significantly large margins.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Detailed Derivation of the Balancing Factor</head><p>In Sec. 3.2.1, we introduce a balancing factor b to handle the retained information levels across modalities, specifically between SAR images and segmentation masks. To quantify the retained information level, we utilize signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), calculated via the 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). For image x ∈ R H×W , the 2D DFT is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">F x (u, v) = H-1 h=0 W -1 w=0 x(h, w) • e -i2π( uh H + vw W ) ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where F x (u, v) represents the complex frequency component of x at the spatial frequency (u, v). Each complex frequency component of a scaled image a • x can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">F ax (u, v) = a • F x (u, v).<label>(12)</label></formula><p>The mean power of image x in frequency domain is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P(x) = E[F x (u, v) • F * x (u, v)],<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where * denotes the complex conjugate. For the scaled image a • x, its mean power is given as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">P(ax) = E[F ax (u, v) • F * ax (u, v)] = E[aF x (u, v) • aF * x (u, v)] = a 2 • E[F x (u, v) • F * x (u, v)] = a 2 • P(x). (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>Using this property, we derive the balancing factor b. In the forward diffusion process, the noise-corrupted SAR image x t and its corresponding segmentation mask y t at timestep t are expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">x t = α t x 0 + σ t ϵ, y t = α t y 0 + σ t ϵ. (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where α t and σ t are scalars determined by the noise scheduler, representing the degree of signal and noise at timestep t, respectively. The SNR is defined as the ratio of the mean power of the signal to the mean power of the noise. So, the SNRs for x t and y t are given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">SNR(x t ) = α 2 t P(x 0 ) σ 2 t P(ϵ) , SNR(y t ) = α 2 t P(y 0 ) σ 2 t P(ϵ) .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>To balance the levels of retained information for a SAR image and its corresponding mask, we scale the original segmentation mask y 0 by the balancing factor b, resulting in a scaled noise-corrupted segmentation mask y ′ t , which is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">y ′ t = α t by 0 + σ t ϵ.<label>(17)</label></formula><p>The SNR for y ′ t is then given by: SNR(y ′ t ) = P(α t by 0 )</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">P(σ t ϵ) = α 2 t b 2 P(y 0 ) σ 2 t P(ϵ) = b 2 • SNR(y t ).<label>(18)</label></formula><p>The ratio of the retained information levels between x t and y ′ t is expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">SNR(x t ) SNR(y ′ t ) = SNR(x t ) b 2 • SNR(y t ) .<label>(19)</label></formula><p>To make this ratio equal to 1, we obtain the balancing factor b as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">b = SNR(x t ) SNR(y t ) = P(x 0 ) P(y 0 ) .<label>(20)</label></formula><p>This balancing factor ensures maintaining balanced information levels of different modalities between SAR images and masks in the forward diffusion process, which is critical for the successful training of SAR-JointNet. That is, this adjustment helps SAR-JointNet to focus equally on the features extracted from SAR images and segmentation masks, enabling more enhanced joint generation.</p></div>

As we described, an one-hot encoded segmentation mask ỹ0 is normalized and scaled by the proposed balancing factor b. Then, we add noise to the scaled segmentation mask y ′ 0 and a SAR image x 0 with respect to a randomly sampled timestep t. Our SAR-JointNet jointly predicts the denoised output xθ for SAR image reconstructions and logits ŷϕ for segmentation mask generations. For SAR image generation learning, we use an L2 loss between xθ and x 0 . For segmentation mask generation learning, we use a cross-entropy loss between ŷϕ and ỹ0 , following [14].</p></div>

From the initial noise sampled from the Gaussian distribution, our SAR-JointNet predicts denoised output, xθ and ŷϕ .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Effect of the Balancing Factor</head><p>In this section, we verify the effectiveness of the balancing factor b derived from the ratio of SNR between the SAR image and its corresponding segmentation mask in SAR-JointNet. We compare the quality of generated data from SAR-JointNet trained using b = 0.528, derived from Eq. (20) and using other values 0.3, 0.7, and 1 on the OSD dataset <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, noise-corrupted segmentation masks without applying b retain significantly more information than noise-corrupted SAR images at the same timestep t. As discussed earlier, smaller values of b reduce the retained information in the noise-corrupted segmentation masks. This encourages SAR-Net within SAR-JointNet to generate SAR images without heavily relying on the mask features transferred through the interconnection layers between SAR-Net and Mask-Net. Consequently, smaller b values lead to improved SAR image quality, as evidenced by better FID and IS in Tab. 6. However, excessively small b values overly suppress the information in the segmentation masks, resulting in information levels even lower than those of the SAR images. This imbalance makes it difficult for Mask-Net to learn effectively.</p><p>Using the predefined value b = 0.3, smaller than the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Effect of CAFT Blocks</head><p>In this section, we conduct an ablation study to validate the performance and effectiveness of our proposed Context-Aware Feature Transfer (CAFT) blocks in skip connection layers. Specifically, we compare our model incorporating CAFT blocks against two baselines with: (i) no additional module in each skip connection, and (ii) 3 × 3 convolution blocks that replace all CAFT blocks in the skip connections Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. For all three models, we leverage the pretrained MambaVision-B [28] as the encoder backbone. To evaluate effectiveness, we compare the number of parameters, FLOPs, inference time, and memory allocation, which are measured using a single 512 × 512 image input (batch size of 1), while the inference time is calculated as the average over 300 runs. All evaluations are conducted on an NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. Additionally, we assess segmentation performance using the mIoU metric on the OSD dataset <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Tab. 7, our full model with CAFT blocks (SAROSS-Net) achieves a higher mIoU while maintaining a lower parameter count, reduced FLOPs, shorter inference time, and lower memory consumption, compared to the 3 × 3 convolution-based baseline. This highlights the efficiency and superior performance of our proposed CAFT blocks in enhancing the capability to selectively transfer high-frequency features to the decoder. As demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>, our SAROSS-Net performs more precise segmentation, which highlights the capability to selectively transfer high-frequency features from noisy SAR images. It effectively captures and refines crucial information, significantly improving segmentation performance.  </p></div>

In Stage 2, SAR-JointNet is trained for 250K iterations on the OSD dataset[37]  and 150K on the SOS dataset [81]. Lastly, in Stage 3, we finetune SAR-JointNet with 100K and 50K iterations on the OSD dataset [37] and the SOS dataset [81], respectively.

(20), demonstrates strong generation quality and achieves the best segmentation performance with 74.86% and 84.27% in mIoU and F1 scores, respectively, for oil spill segmentation on OSD dataset[37].</figDesc><table><row><cell>Methods</cell><cell cols="2">Params.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_8"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>To address this limitation, we adopt a technique inspired by mosaic augmentation used in YOLOv4[4], where four randomly selected 256 × 256 generated images and combine them to form a 512 × 512 composite image. While this method is practical, it does not fully resolve the challenge of high-resolution SAR image synthesis. Future work should aim to develop efficient models capable of generating high-resolution SAR images while preserving their unique noise characteristics.</figDesc><table><row><cell>SAR image</cell><cell>Aug.

Segmentation performance on the impact of the amount of the augmented dataset for training of oil spill segmentation on the OSD dataset [37]. E. Impact of the Amount of Augmented Dataset We further evaluate the impact of the amount of the aug-mented dataset from SAR-JointNet on segmentation per-formance. By systematically varying the amount of the augmented samples for the training of SAROSS-Net, we aim to analyze how additional generated data contributes to the model's learning ability to generalize and accurately segment target regions. Tab. 8 shows the segmentation performance on the usage amounts of augmented samples generated by SAR-JointNet. Note that the original OSD dataset [37] contains 1, 002 samples, while the numbers of generated samples are 1,120 (1×), 2,240 (2×), and 4,480 (4×), corresponding to the number of original training sam-ples. Both the original training dataset and generated aug-mented datasets are used together to train SAROSS-Net. As demonstrated, the segmentation performance consistently improves as the size (number) of the augmented samples increases, highlighting the importance of generative data augmentation in enhancing the segmentation performance. F. Limitations While our DAKD pipeline successfully generates SAR im-ages and their corresponding segmentation masks using our SAR-JointNet, it is currently constrained to a resolution of 256 × 256. Extending SAR-JointNet, a pixel-domain dif-fusion model, to generate spatially larger images, such as 512 × 512, requires significantly more computational re-sources. Although the latent diffusion model (LDM) [52] has demonstrated successful generation capability for high-resolution natural images, we observed that LDM struggles to synthesize speckle noise of SAR images in the latent do-main, which is typically reduced to 1/8 or 1/4 of the origi-Look-alike Sea Surface nal image size.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sentiment analysis of scientific citations has received much attention in recent years because of the increased availability of scientific publications. Scholarly databases are valuable sources for publications and citation information where researchers can publish their ideas and results. Sentiment analysis of scientific citations aims to analyze the authors' sentiments within scientific citations. During the last decade, some review papers have been published in the field of sentiment analysis. Despite the growth in the size of scholarly databases and researchers' interests, no one as far as we know has carried out an in-depth survey in a specific area of sentiment analysis in scientific citations. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of sentiment analysis of scientific citations. In this review, the process of scientific citation sentiment analysis is introduced and recently proposed methods with the main challenges are presented, analyzed and discussed. Further, we present related fields such as citation function classification and citation recommendation that have recently gained enormous attention. Our contributions include identifying the most important challenges as well as the analysis and classification of recent methods used in scientific citation sentiment analysis. Moreover, it presents the normal process, and this includes citation context extraction, public data sources, and feature selection. We found that most of the papers use classical machine learning methods. However, due to limitations of performance and manual feature selection in machine learning, we believe that in the future hybrid and deep learning methods can possibly handle the problems of scientific citation sentiment analysis more efficiently and reliably.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With the rapid growth of digital libraries and the wide access to scholarly publications, it has become possible for researchers to explore and process massive amounts of scientific data with the aim of extracting scientific knowledge. Currently, digital libraries contain a big number of online scholarly publications. The aim of digital libraries is to collect and store all relevant publications in one database. For example, the IEEE Xplore Digital Library contains a collection of full-text publications and citations from IEEE journals, conference proceedings, technical magazines, and books. The IEEE digital library allows users to browse and search quickly for a specific scientific publication. For every publication, the library lists its references and all articles that have cited it. This is accomplished by citation index services such as Google Scholar. These services allow researchers to find publications and citation information.</p><p>A citation is a text that references previous work for different purposes such as comparing, criticizing, or acknowledging different sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Alvarez and GÃ³mez 2014)</ref>. Citations have been used to characterize and obtain information on different types of documents. As an example for scientific articles, the number of citations received has been used to determine the impact of a paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Garfield 1972</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Garfield , 1979))</ref>. Citation information can be described as citation count or citation context.</p><p>A citation context can be defined as a text or several sentences surrounding references in the body of a publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Small 2011)</ref>. Citations can be classified as explicit or implicit citations. Explicit citation refers to the sentence or group of sentences around a reference position in a paper <ref type="bibr">(Athar and Teufel 2012b)</ref>. Implicit citation is a sentence close to reference position but there is no direct linkage to that reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Qazvinian and Radev 2010)</ref>. To illustrate the types of citation context, we use the following example. Consider the following citation: Active learning (AL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Wang et al. 2012</ref>) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) are two well-known techniques that make use of unlabeled data to improve classification performance. Both techniques are iterative processes and reported good performance compared to supervised approaches. In this example, the first sentence is an explicit citation, and the second sentence is an implicit citation.</p><p>Citation count is one of the citation analysis methods for evaluating research results of research units such as journals and departments <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Garfield 1972)</ref>. It is the number of times a particular publication has been cited by researchers. The number of citations that a research unit has received determines its quality or impact. However, this evaluation method is incomplete and may not calculate the impact of research units perfectly <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Abu-Jbara et al. 2013)</ref>. Therefore, many researchers have exploited citation contexts to analyze the reasons, influence, and sentiment of the cited articles in the citing articles to build more accurate methods to evaluate the research results.</p><p>Citation context is a good source for different applications that demand knowing citation purpose or reasons for quoting a concept, using approaches, and criticizing an idea from prior literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Teufel et al. 2006)</ref>. For example, researchers can capture the citation purpose or sentiment about a certain journal and build a new citation analysis method that integrates citation count with the authors' opinion when citing articles from that journal. This particular new technique may improve the methods of research quality assessment. In addition, as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Athar (2014)</ref>, it is interesting for young researchers to understand the common perspective of the literature in a particular field. This understanding can aid them to discover the gaps in the literature simply by analyzing the negative citation of papers. It could be helpful for them to know the contributions of researchers in that field by identifying the positive polarity of cited work in citing work. Polarity can be positive, negative or neutral; According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Abu-Jbara et al. (2013)</ref> citation polarity can be defined slightly different from the definition in sentiment analysis (SA). Positive citation directly expresses the strength of the cited papers, e.g. if the cited work compared with other works and considered better in the final results. Negative citation expresses the drawbacks and weakness of cited work explicitly, e.g., if it is compared to another paper and considered worse in any way. Neutral citation is just a description of a specific idea without any sentiments.</p><p>So far, social media platforms are the main source of opinionated information. Currently, scholarly databases are the new domain that can provide an opportunity to find out authors' sentiment through evaluating citation information in academic publications. However, mining authors' attitudes from digital library documents specifically citation context is difficult because of the characteristics of citation information <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Alvarez and GÃ³mez 2014)</ref>. Extracting opinionated citation information about entities such as topics, ideas, and theories is a complex task because of the issue of avoiding criticism in academic writing. Therefore, it is challenging to identify the correct citation context and mining sentiment in scholarly publications. Mining authors' sentiments in scholarly publications specifically analyzing the citation context of the cited works for understanding the authors' attitudes for citing the previous literature is knowns as sentiment analysis.</p><p>Scientific citation sentiment analysis (SCSA) is a new domain in the sentiment analysis field with the aim to detect the attitudes of authors towards cited works <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Athar 2011)</ref>. In this study, domain refers to document types such as product reviews, forums, news articles, and citations, in which researchers can apply a specific technique to detect the sentiment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Parthasarathy and Tomar (2015)</ref> presented a brief review. They focused on defining the topic of sentiment analysis of citations and suggested supervised machine learning techniques as future methods to study SCSA. Their survey is however limited to consider important issues in this field. Our survey is different, since we provide comprehensive survey that includes presenting common sentiment and citation concepts that are useful for beginners to gain a general idea of the field. Further, we present important concepts in SCSA that include the normal process of SCSA and the most important challenges. Furthermore, we introduce related topics to SCSA.</p><p>The contributions of our survey lie in presenting current developments and to review existing techniques as follows: (1) We present studies based on the methods applied. This can aid researchers and outsiders to the field develop a basic understanding of the SCSA research field. The presented techniques are also critically discussed based on their pros and cons. (2) We cover fields related to SCSA that have attracted research interest are also covered. These fields include citation function classification and citation recommendation.</p><p>(3) This survey presents different datasets that are commonly utilized in SCSA. We explain the procedure of citation context extraction of existing datasets. Finally, this survey discusses some open problems and recommendations for future research.</p><p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents the background of this work including SA and the SCSA process. Section 3 shows the research methodology. Section 4 analyzes and discusses SCSA challenges and techniques. In Sect. 5, we introduce related fields to SCSA. Section 6 presents future recommendation. Finally, the conclusions of this paper are provided in Sect. 7.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Sentiment analysis</head><p>Sentiment analysis (SA) is a growing field of research influenced by and reaching into text mining, machine learning, computational linguistics, and natural language processing. It is a method of processing and analyzing people's attitudes, opinions, sentiments, and the subjectivity of text <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Liu 2012)</ref>. SA can help to gain many benefits and achieve different goals such as measuring customer satisfaction, checking customers' opinions in the intelligence market, and forecasting movie sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jiang et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kang and Park 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Li and Tsai 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Rui et al. 2013)</ref>. Applications of SA can be found in different domains. For example, product reviews mainly helps users to evaluate different products before they buy. Such methods may help them to select the proper and high-quality items through the analysis of comments of reviewers. Analyzing the attitudes of people in a specific event such as presidential campaign could help the voters to decide which candidate they will support <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Wang et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>A significant number of literature surveys have been published in recent years in the area of SA that have explored SA as well as opinion mining tasks, approaches, and applications in different domains. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pang and Lee (2008)</ref> conducted a comprehensive review of SA. Their survey discussed several applications of SA, its main challenges and tasks. They grouped SA tasks into categories and elaborated each one in detail. The tasks include sentiment extraction, sentiment classification, opinion summarization, and polarity determination. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr">Tang et al. (2009)</ref> presented SA issues such as sentiment classification in a different level of analysis, sentiment extraction, and subjectivity classification. Machine learning approaches such as NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) classifier and Multiple NB classifier have been demonstrated as methods for subjectivity analysis. O'Leary (2011) presented a survey on SA on the blog. This work focused on the process of searching and extracting the opinions from blogs. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Montoyo et al. (2012)</ref> presented the limitations of SA with achievements. In their paper, they suggested the lack of non-English resources and social and cultural dependence of these resources for SA as open problems to be addressed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Tsytsarau and Palpanas (2012)</ref> conducted a survey on SA and discussed opinion mining and opinion aggregation. The comparison was made by applying several opinion mining techniques using public datasets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Liu and Zhang (2012)</ref> presented SA and opinion mining tasks and these tasks include subjectivity and sentiment classification, sentiment lexicon generation, aspect-based SA, analysis of comparative opinions, opinion summarization, opinion search and retrieval and opinion spam detection and quality of reviews. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cambria et al. (2013)</ref> presented a survey about SA challenges and difficulties.</p><p>Moreover, Feldman (2013) concentrated on five issues related to SA areas such as sentiment lexicon generation, comparative SA, sentence-level SA, and aspect-based SA. The authors also presented composition statement, automatic entity recognition, sarcasm detection and subjectivity classification as the new open issues in SA domains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Medhat et al. (2014)</ref> performed a survey of fifty-four articles by covering sentiment classification and feature selection methods. The authors only focused on sentiment classification methods and presented its tasks, algorithms, data sources, language type and domain.</p><p>Recently, deep learning methods have become a popular solution to address SA tasks. Rojas-Barahona (2016) reviewed recent works on deep learning for SA and grouped deep learning models into recursive, non-recursive, and the combination of both models. The authors also compared the document level and sentence level SA on two datasets. They conclude that deep learning models can be a better solution for polarity detection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Poria et al. (2016)</ref> proposed use of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from multimodal content and feed these features to a multiple kernel learning classifier for sentiment detection. Their method manages to achieve good results using different datasets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Tang et al. (2016)</ref> proposed supervised learning model based on long short term memory algorithm. In this model, a sentence representation was made by capturing the link between each target word and its contexts. They reported that incorporating target information improves the classification accuracy of the proposed model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Akhtar et al. (2016)</ref> proposed a hybrid approach that utilizes CNN to learn embedded features and then used a multi-objective genetic algorithm based optimization technique to generate the sentiment augmented optimized vector. They trained SVM with non-linear kernel for sentiment detection.</p><p>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cambria (2016)</ref> studied affective computing and sentiment analysis and presented emotion recognition, polarity detection, subjectivity detection, opinion target identification, and multimodal fusion as the main tasks. They also listed three categories to handle these tasks with their advantages and disadvantages namely: knowledge-based techniques, statistical methods, and hybrid approaches. They recommend ensemble application of semantic knowledge and machine learning as the best way for addressing the tasks of affective computing and sentiment analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Piryani et al. (2017)</ref> collected opinion mining (OM) and SA publications published in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) journals from the year 2000 to 2015. They performed a useful scientometric and manual analysis to explain the SA research status. Scientometric analysis was used to identify the percentage of growth of OMSA publications, top productive countries, universities, journals and authors. The manual analysis aimed to identify popular methods used in these publications, levels of SA and key application areas of OM and SA. Their results are valuable for SA and OM researchers.</p><p>On the other hand, multimodal, multilingual, multi-domain SA systems have gained more attention recently. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Soleymani et al. (2017)</ref> conducted a review about multimodal sentiment analysis in different domains such as product reviews, video blogs, and images. They introduced the problem of multimodal sentiment analysis and presented the main challenges in this field. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dragoni (2017)</ref> built a tool for multi-domain sentiment analysis by exploiting word embedding with recurrent neural network. They used word embedding to generate word representation and then train recurrent network model. In their model, multiple output layers were used to combine the scores of overlapping domains with domain-specific polarity scores. This combination allows the use of linguistic overlaps between domains. They calculate the overall polarity by multiplying domain-specific polarity value with the overlap between the representation of the entire sentences and the domain itself. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Vilares et al. (2017)</ref> performed multilingual polarity classification on Twitter and compared three different approaches namely multilingual, dual monolingual, and monolingual models. Monolingual model is based on a language identification tool. These models were evaluated using English and Spanish tweets, and the multilingual approach performed better than other models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Valdivia et al. (2017)</ref> suggested the TripAdvisor platform as a source of data for SA tasks in the tourism domain. They stated that, it is difficult to adapt existing SA techniques because of the content nature of the TripAdvisor reviews. Moreover, they presented aspect-based SA, irony and sarcasm detection, and spam detection as future challenges. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Zhao et al. (2017)</ref> proposed a deep learning model to detect the sentiment from product reviews by incorporating rating information of the product reviews. The proposed model contains two steps: learning representation to capture sentiment distribution of reviews through rating information and using a few label data for sentiment prediction.</p><p>Moreover, the combination of multiple deep learning algorithms could be useful for improving the performance of SA models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hassan and Mahmood (2017)</ref>   <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) combined CNN and LSTM to solve the task of aspect-level sentiment analysis for news articles. This combination is useful when it requires capturing the semantic of the words and the association between them. One of the recent directions of SA is to enhance the teaching process through analyzing the comments of students about the learning resources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rani and Kumar (2017)</ref> proposed SA' system for students to improve the process of teaching and learning by analyzing their feedback about a specific course. The proposed system contains data collection and preprocessing, sentiment detection, satisfaction and dissatisfaction computation, and data visualization. Their system classified sentiment into positive and negative. Whereas emotion were classified into different categorizes. They tested their system using data from Coursera<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> , which contain multilingual student feedback. All of the above-mentioned survey papers only focused on traditional domains such as micro-blogs and product reviews. To the best of our knowledge, there is no review paper that studied sentiment analysis in the specific domain of citations.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the relationship between SA and scientific citations. In this figure, there are different domains to detect user's sentiment such as product review, micro blogs, and discussion forums. Citations are considered a new document type or domain in which an author's sentiment could be detected.</p><p>SCSA has become an important research field unlike other domains such as micro-blogs and product reviews because the citation texts are different in content type, language, and text styles. One of the possible uses of SCSA is to improve the bibliometric measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Abu-Jbara et al. 2013</ref>) such as the impact factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Garfield 1979</ref>) that can help in identifying the article's impact. In addition, it can support researchers in understanding previous contributions and limitations of proposed theories, tools and methods in a specific field <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Athar 2014)</ref>. Another use of SCSA is to recognize problems and gaps in a particular topic through classifying the literature findings as positive or negative contributions. SCSA faces several problems, and it is difficult to detect authors' opinions behind quoting others. It is even more challenging when we want to apply subjective analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">SCSA process</head><p>In this subsection, we present SCSA process which primarily includes extracting citation context from scholarly publications. We also present how citation context can be used to build annotated dataset, and explain extracting features that can be used to detect citation sentiment. Machine learning techniques specifically supervised learning approaches are commonly used for performing SCSA. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the normal process of SCSA and all steps to analyze citation context and identifying authors' attitudes.</p><p>As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, the first step is citation context identification that is extracted from scholarly publications and labeled as positive, negative or neutral. The labeled citation contexts represent training data. Identifying correct citation context should be performed carefully, and it is not an easy task to extract and annotate the citation context. Section 2.2.1 shows more details about extracting the citation contexts.</p><p>-In the second step, the feature extraction where the feature sets are extracted for training machine learning classifier. Selecting correct and relevant feature set could improve the classifier performance. More details about the feature extraction process are presented in Sect. 2.2.2. -Third step involves machine learning classifier using labeled citation context as an input to build a model for classifying the citation as positive, negative or neutral. -In the last step, the classifier performance can be evaluated using information retrieval evaluation methods such as precision, recall, and accuracy metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tang et al. 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Citation context extraction</head><p>Citation context extraction is a fundamental step in several applications such as citation summarization, survey generation and SCSA. Regarding identifying citation context, many researchers have used different techniques and tools to extract citation context in a more developed way. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Councill et al. (2008)</ref> developed ParsCit, which is an open-source software tool for extracting citation context from research papers. This tool utilized conditional random field technique as a trained machine learning model to annotate the extracted tokens in the references' string and then identifying and retrieving citation sentences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wan and Liu (2014)</ref> used this tool to parse the entire papers and then extract citation sentences and other metadata to estimate the importance of each citation. They argue that citation polarity scores are not equally important and employed support vector regression with features such as the occurrence number of reference, reference location, self-cited reference and others to estimate the strength value of each citation. Their method manages to achieve better mean squared error of 0.541 compared with baseline methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kaplan et al. (2009)</ref> employed a co-reference-chain based approach to extract citation with the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and to handle strings of citation in the message understanding conference dataset 2 . They created a corpus comprised of 38 research papers taken from the field of computational linguistics as dataset. They manually labeled the corpus and used it for the paper summarization task. They reported higher classification results compared with the cue-phrase-based technique. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Sugiyama et al. (2010)</ref> carried out the supervised learning methods with n-grams and other features such as previous and next sentence, proper nouns, orthographic characteristics, and position. They reported that a citation could be classified into citing or non-citing. They utilized maximum entropy and SVM for performing the classification. Their results revealed that proper nouns and contextual classification were best features to train precise models in maximum entropy (ME) and SVM approaches. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Angrosh et al. (2013)</ref> employed a conditional random field method and developed the CitContExt software which could detect the both non-contextual and contextual type of sentences. They used different schemas, which suffer from annotation difficulty, multiclass function imbalance, and limited labeled dataset. For citation summarization application, Abu-Jbara et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) focus on identifying the fragment of a citing sentence. They recognized the importance of a reference scope and then used different methods (word classification SVM, sequence labeling, and segment classification) and such segment classification approach seems to be effective in identifying the scope of reference. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Radev et al. (2009)</ref> used SVM to classify citation sentences after the employment of the belief propagation mechanism for identifying context sentences, and for that, a window of four sentences can be used for citation based summarization. Their work is the first one that extracts implicit citation sentences. They reported best performance for citation summarization due to the combination of explicit and implicit citation sentences.</p><p>Small (2011) used a large corpus of cue words showing sentiment and function from a set of 20 papers. The author analyzed citation sentiments using one to three sentences as citation context to understand the structure and underlying cognitive and social processes. The author reported that sentiments varied within specialty and is related to cognitive and social reasons.</p><p>On the other hand, implicit or indirect citations are more difficult than explicit citation sentences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Athar (2011)</ref> used the supervised learning approach with a window of four sentences and employed the SVM with n-grams of length 1-3 and other features to detect citations. Their results indicated that the implementation of such an approach is useful in detecting explicit citations. This work did not extract implicit citations. To solve the problem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Sondhi and Zhai (2014)</ref> utilized a constrained Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to extract non-explicit citing sentences. They trained a separate HMM, and then a constrained joint inference was used to annotate the implicit citation sentences. To test their model, they chose from ACL Anthology 10 natural language processing papers and manually annotated as citing or non-citing sentences. Their proposed constrained HMM effectively extracts implicit citation context, and outperforms the baselines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kim et al. (2014)</ref> collected biomedical articles and applied SVM with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) as a kernel function. They proposed features such as word statistics, author names, publication years, and citation tags in a sentence. They achieved better performance in extracting citation sentences by using a rule-based approach as a post-processing step. They also developed rule-based post processing technique to reduce the errors in extracting citation sentences. They reported good performance in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy.</p><p>Widyantoro and Amin (2014) combined regular expression-based patterns, evidencebased approach, co-reference system, and additional extraction rule to extract citation sentences. They conducted experiments using supervised learning approaches such as NB, Complement NB and decision tree with n-grams, sentence length, cue phrases and thematic word as feature sets. The thematic word reported high F1 value in all approaches compared to other features. One of the recent applications that used citation context is recommendation systems. Citation context can assist to recommend references to a specific section in the articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Livne et al. 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the use of citation context in SCSA, <ref type="bibr">Athar and Teufel (2012a)</ref> stated that citation contexts are more important to detect author's sentiment than using only one sentence. In other words, the window with multiple sentences can cover a large number of opinion words compared with selecting simply one sentence. They built and annotated a corpus that includes explicit and implicit citation for citation polarity classification. Similarly, Jochim and Schutze (2012) suggested using citation context with multiple sentences as window size to detect sentiment in the citation. Therefore, the optimal window size should be carefully selected, and it can affect the performance of the above-mentioned applications. Despite the existence of many tools and algorithms for extracting citation context, it is still very problematic as all up-to-date approaches do not sufficiently detect the optimal size of citation context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Data sources for SCSA</head><p>SCSA has a variety of data sources coming from different domains and easily accessible online. Scholarly publications are a great source of citation data. The fundamental source of such data is the digital libraries and citation analysis tools such as IEEE digital library, Web of Science<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> , Google Scholar, and Scopus<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> . Researchers can use digital libraries and citation analysis tools for downloading publications and then extract citation context to study SCSA.</p><p>Several data formats are available such as Portable Document Format (PDF) and Extensible Markup language (XML). For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Parthasarathy and Tomar (2014)</ref> chose 10 PDF papers from SA field to address citation polarity classification problem. They focused on extracting citation sentences from full-text papers, and then they used part of speech tags for identifying adjective words. Finally, they classify the citation sentences into a polarity level. On the other hand, the pre-processing of these kinds of data is not an easy task. It needs deep preprocessing methods to convert such a PDF format to plain text. The unstructured converted text could be used as an input to the parsing algorithms for extracting citation context from the papers.</p><p>One of the important sources of citation widely used to study SCSA is ACL Anthology corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Radev et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Radev et al. , 2013))</ref>. This corpus has been used by some researchers to build their own datasets. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Athar 2011</ref>) built a corpus that includes 8,736 instances and three classes, which are positive, negative and neutral. The author used SVM with different features for citation sentiment detection. Another annotated corpus is created by the same author, and it has 203,803 instances. Moreover, Abu-Jbara et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) chose 30 papers to study citation classification with the aim to categorize citations into different purposes or functions. Other researchers also used the same corpus for performing automatic survey generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Jha et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Jha et al. , 2015) )</ref> and citation scope identification (Abu-Jbara and Radev 2012) . Jochim and Schutze (2014) created another corpus which contains 2,008 instances, and adapted deep learning approach with n-grams features to improve citation sentiment polarity. The authors utilized labeled dataset from product review domain and handled the sentiment classification as a domain adaptation problem. Using the approach, they obtained better results compared with using citation data only. Recently, Hernandez- <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Alvarez and Gomez (2015)</ref> built another annotated citation corpus for citation function classification and polarity analysis, which contains 2092 instances. All of the above-mentioned datasets are in computer science field specifically from the computational linguistic due to the availability of full-text papers and metadata in the ACL Anthology.</p><p>The current publicly available datasets for SCSA are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. The first column refers to the reference information; the second column is a corpus name, and the last column refers to the number of examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Feature selection for SCSA</head><p>Feature selection is an important technique in SCSA. It can identify the sentiment of a text. The chosen features and their combination may affect the performance of a machine learning classifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Nicholls and Song 2010)</ref>. Therefore, the fundamental role for finding the sentiment of a text is to choose the best feature set. Various kinds of features have been used and discussed within the SA literature such as n-gram <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Tripathy et al. 2016</ref>) and information from sentiment lexicons <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cho et al. 2014</ref>). To deal with SCSA, three types of textual features have been proposed to detect citation sentiment namely: syntactic features, semantic features, and citation specific features. Here, we provide the most common features that have been used for SCSA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Syntactic features</head><p>The most applied features are syntactical features, and these include uni-grams, bi-grams, ngrams, sentence splitting, POS tags, and dependency relations. Their purpose is to investigate the effect of a variety of terms on SCSA. Machine learning classifier trained on unigrams is usually used as a baseline for comparison purposes. In addition, POS tag is another syntactic feature that can get information that reveals sentiment such as adjectives, adverbs, and verbs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Athar (2011)</ref> reported the best classification results by using dependency relations based on the idea that the words and other linguistic units were connected to each other by directed links. Dependency trees create syntactical relations between the words within a sentence. In dependency trees, the verb is a center of the sentence, and the rest linguistic units are connected to the verb with syntactical relations. This feature is crucial for entity-level SCSA, as it implies associations of the sentiment words and the sentiment target. Sentence splitting is another feature that was used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Abu-Jbara et al. (2013)</ref> for polarity classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semantic features</head><p>The most applied semantic features in SCSA are keywords, semantic patterns, and negation. Sentiment words refer to positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment words and phrases are the most utilized features for citation sentiment classification. Kumar (2016) manually created a list of positive and negative words from a citation corpus and used it to classify the citation as positive or negative. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Parthasarathy and Tomar (2014)</ref> used SentiWordNet lexicon <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Esuli and Sebastiani 2006)</ref> to produce additional features for training machine learning classifiers. Other researchers explore the advantages of using the semantic patterns that are hidden in citation context. For example, Hernandez- <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Alvarez and Gomez (2015)</ref> extracted semantic patterns from citation contexts such as data, experiments, paper, field, and others for identifying citation sentiment polarity. An additional feature that is very important for SCSA is negation, which may inverse the polarity of citation context. Features that mean negations have been examined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Athar 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Athar , 2014))</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Citation specific feature</head><p>Researchers have also evaluated various features that are specific to citation area. Many researchers have assessed the effect of those features on SCSA. For example, Abu-Jbara et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) used self-citation and reference count features with other features to analyze author's sentiment in citing papers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Athar (2011)</ref> proposed author name, formal citation, section markers, and citation lists. Their work reported the best classification results with using syntactic features, specifically the dependency trees. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ma et al. (2016)</ref> proposed p-index feature, which is extending the traditional h-index method for finding the popularity of researchers with the aim of improving the research's quality measurements. They reported improvement over other features in the citation polarity task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Research methodology</head><p>This section provides a brief outline of the research methodology adopted for conducting the review study. It includes the literature scope, search methodology, search databases, and search terms used.</p><p>Regarding the scope, the literatures on SA cover studies that perform analysis on collections of texts mined from social media, product reviews, news, blogs, etc. We are mainly interested in studies that combine technical with nontechnical features, as these studies pioneer the new research opportunities presented by SCSA. However, we also include studies that are used to extract citation context from scientific papers.</p><p>The area of SA is still in its early stage since it has not reached a level of maturity at which research questions can be posed of a well-defined body of literature. We aim to define, collect and curate the disparate literature, arguing and showing that there does, indeed, exists coherent area of research in the field that can be termed scientific citation sentiment analysis. The authors applied inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criterion involves: First, all papers that related to the field of SA or opinion mining and may have a close relationship or dependency on scientific citations domain. Second, all papers related to scientific citation domains, clearly about the use of scientific citation context extraction and identification methods to get citation context from the research papers or articles.</p><p>Regarding the search databases, the authors performed the search on several research repositories or databases for papers to include in the study with the aim not to miss the key research articles. ACM Digital Library<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> , Springer<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> , Science Direct<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">foot_6</ref> , IEEE<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">foot_7</ref> and Google Scholar<ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">foot_8</ref> which clearly turned out to match the findings performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Feldman (2013)</ref> who found almost the same number (more than 7000) of relevant studies that particularly discuss SA areas.</p><p>For the search terms used, we performed search for the following terms and phrases, to cover the subfields of SA that we identify: "scientific citation", "citation classification", "citation polarity analysis", "citation motivation", "citation survey generation", and "citation impact methods".</p><p>The exclusion criterion applied in this survey is as follows: first, all papers clearly focused on SA or opinion mining but do not extend or cover areas related to scientific citations domain, for example, blogs, social media, news, etc. are excluded. Second, all papers that have clearly mentioned scientific citation but use it for different purpose, for example, citation analysis, bibliometric methods, citation motivation, citation summarization, citation survey generation, etc. Last, all papers that explicitly mention scientific citation but use it for scientific citation extraction in different application areas.</p><p>In the search methodology, to gather all the relevant literature so far that meet the scope defined above, the authors performed a systematic search for the terms in each research database stated below. The relevant papers were collected into tables, and a decision was made based on the inclusion criteria and was conducted in three stages: first, we removed research publications that are clearly irrelevant from the title. Then, the authors read the abstract and removed the publications which were clearly irrelevant according to the scope. Finally, the results were read fully and a decision was made as to whether the paper (a) met the key criteria as "scientific citation sentiment analysis" as defined in our scope, or (b) was explicitly relevant to the field and so should be included as well. All those papers matching the criteria of (a) or (b) were included in this survey. The summary of the number of accepted primary papers found through the author's search can be found in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SCSA challenges and techniques</head><p>In this section, we introduce the most important SCSA challenges, and present and analyze/discuss the existing techniques that have been used to detect the sentiment of the authors in scientific citations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">SCSA challenges</head><p>Detecting sentiment in the citation data is a nontrivial task and differs much from detecting sentiment in classical texts or domains such as blog sites and online forums. Specialists who try to build valuable SCSA techniques have to face several difficulties that appear from the unique features of citation context. One of the most important difficulties is the text style and lack of opinionated terms in scientific documents. Further, they have to deal with the issue of extracting citation contexts from research articles and feature extraction problem. Here, we provide essential SCSA difficulties:</p><p>Citation context extraction Identifying the correct citation context is an important issue in SCSA. Most of the current research as presented in Sect. 2.2.1 used simple methods to extract the best citation that represents the author's comments. The main limitations of the citation extraction techniques are using a limited number of articles as a corpus, and using simple ways to address citation extraction such as regular expression (Abu-Jbara and Radev 2012; Parthasarathy and Tomar 2014). Further, the extracted contexts are different; some researchers extract only one sentence, and the others use an entire paragraph. Therefore, it is a challenging task to extract citation context accurately.</p><p>Citation context handling Citation handling is the preprocessing steps aiming to clean citation context. Scientific citations have different styles such as Harvard's style and IEEE style, and these styles can affect the parsing of citation context from publications. Citations can be classified as constituent citations or parenthetical citations. Constituent citations play a clear role in the syntactic structure of a citation sentence, and removing these citations may affect the grammaticality of the sentence. They typically occur as noun phrases and may take on the role of agents who did or claimed something. On the other hand, parenthetical citations are citations that are structurally independent of the sentence; removing them cannot affect the sentence grammatically. They are typically used as an instance of some event or situation mentioned in the sentence <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Whidby 2012</ref>). As a result, citation context handling is not easy, and it needs more attention to correct the errors in the citation contexts that represents the contribution of the cited work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Citation context length (Window size)</head><p>There is a difficulty in extracting information holding opinions from scientific publications because most of the authors hide their sentiments when they assess the work of other researchers. Also, the citation purposes or reasons are not directly displayed to avoid criticism and as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">MacRoberts and MacRoberts (1984)</ref>, most of the contents of academic publications are facts and descriptive and do not contain any opinionated information. They also report that negative sentiment mostly appears in the findings' sections because of the comparison between current results and previous authors' findings. However, choosing the best citation context length is not easy at all; it needs more attention in identifying the best window size, that is, the number of sentences that contain authors' sentiments.</p><p>Citation annotation Citation annotation is normally the way to assign a label to the document or sentences. One major challenge in making new datasets is precisely how the citation context should be labeled. Until now, only one approach has been used for annotating citation contexts according to their polarity: manual annotation has been conducted for several datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Athar 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hernandez-Alvarez and Gomez 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Jochim and Schutze 2014)</ref>. One limitation of this approach is that it is difficult to label large datasets. Therefore, this approach can help annotating few citation contexts. The kappa coefficient of inter-annotator agreement is the main method to calculate the quality of the annotation process. Automatic citation annotation is a challenging task and until now; no one can label citation context annotation automatically. Therefore, automatic labeling is one of the challenges in SCSA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature extraction</head><p>The problem of extracting features from a given citation context of a cited work is important for the effective application of machine learning. Feature extraction is commonly assumed to be a technique to find the best transformation from raw data into features that can be used as an input for a learning algorithm. It seems that feature selection has more effect than algorithm selection in SCSA as presented in Sect. 2.2.3. Therefore, selecting and extracting features for classifying citation context into positive, negative or neutral are challenging issues in SCSA.</p><p>Tokenization Tokenization is the process of dividing a sentence into words or tokens for subsequent analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Webster and Kit 1992)</ref>. It is difficult to tokenize citation sentences to detect the correct words because English in other SA domains is different from scientific text in vocabulary and grammar <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Barrett 2012)</ref>. Moreover, the structures of scientific information are different <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Harris 2002)</ref>. In this context, instead of dividing the sentences depending on the whitespace, the researchers can choose the right tokenization tools. One of the best software to tokenize the citation context is Stanford's natural language processing tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Manning et al. 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Negation Presence of negation words has an important role in finding the sentiment polarity of a citation context. The recognition and the correct handling of negation are not simple and are still a problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hogenboom et al. 2011</ref>). Finding negations is important, mainly because they may result in the reverse of a citation context polarity (positive can become negative or conversely). <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Athar (2011)</ref> used a negation window of 15 words in SCSA as a feature, and this improves the performance of the classification. The author reported that the improvement was not found to be statistically significant because of skewed class distribution and suggested that a larger dataset may prove to be useful. Besides, the author reported that modeling negations using explicit and implicit are helpful in improving citation sentiment detection. Therefore, detecting the negation scope on large citation dataset maybe considered a challenge in SCSA.</p><p>Stop words Stop words are common words, which have minimum discrimination power and they are often sifted out before handling the text. Public precompiled stop-words lists are suitable for SA on tweeter data <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Saif et al. 2014</ref>). In the citation context, stop words may even affect the SCSA performance. For example, the word "like" commonly is considered a stop word, and it has an important sentiment discrimination influence in SCSA. As a result, there has been some work focused on using stop-words lists for citation classification. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abdullatif et al. (2015)</ref> presented a study in which they remove some stop words such as "a, of, on" because these words affect the size of the classifiers feature space for computing the similarity in citation classification. However, they chose a small set not to remove words that could play an important role on citation classification effectiveness. We infer that some of the stop words are needed to improve the sentiment classification such as adjectives and adverbs, but others should be removed to reduce the dimension of a feature space.</p><p>Multimodal content Occasionally, citation context includes multimodal content such as tables or figures. Table or figure analysis may be useful for SCSA, as it could offer helpful information on identifying the sentiment of the author's cited work. It may be possible to extract the comparison part in a table and from that we can say the high results show positive sentiment of one paper compared with another one. However, features extraction from multimodal content for SCSA is still an under-explored field.</p><p>Multilingual content Citation contexts are authored in large different languages and occasionally combined even in the same context. Mining user sentiment in multilingual content is a challenging task <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Denecke 2008)</ref>. The problem for language recognition rises because of the special characters of citation context. This problem is still unsolved and may be in the next few years the researchers can develop tools and techniques for handling this issue.</p><p>Lack of benchmark datasets One of the most important problems in this research area is the lack of benchmark datasets. It has been noticed that researchers collect their own data and evaluate their methods on them. The comparison of different methods is very difficult or even impossible. Lack of benchmark datasets is also observed in fields that are related to SCSA such as citation classification. Even creating benchmarked collection on these fields is very challenging, but it is not impossible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">SCSA techniques</head><p>SCSA has been employed at three different levels: document, sentence, and entity levels. The analysis of document level aims to recognize the sentiment polarity conveyed in the entire document (the document, here is a citation context, and should be a paragraph). The sentence level seeks to classify each citation sentence as positive or negative whereas the entity-level finds the sentiment polarity of a particular entity of a specific object. There are four techniques for solving SCSA challenges that can be identified in the literature of SCSA, which are machine learning approaches, lexicon-based approaches, deep learning approaches, and keyword based approach.</p><p>Machine-learning approach uses a machine-learning technique with various features to develop a classifier that can identify citation context that reveals sentiment. The lexicon-based approach utilizes a manually or automatically constructed list of positive and negative words to obtain the polarity of the citation contexts. Deep learning approaches are new techniques for feature representation in SCSA, and there are few researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jochim and Schutze 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Munkhdalai et al. 2016</ref>) that have used these techniques. Keyword based approach is another way to deal with detecting sentiment in citation context by extracting the most important keywords from citation context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Machine learning techniques</head><p>The majority of the proposed techniques that address SCSA issues apply a classifier from the area of machine learning, which is trained on various features of citation context. Some of the widely used machine-learning classifiers include the SVM and Naive Bayes (NB). The following is a review of these techniques.</p><p>One of the first researchers handling SCSA was <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Athar (2011)</ref> who addressed the problem as a binary classification, categorizing the citation as either positive or negative. Due to the absence of citation corpus for analyzing the sentiment of citation, the author extracted citation sentences from ACL Anthology corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Radev et al. 2009</ref>) and manually labeled 8736 citations from 310 articles. Different features are extracted from the pre-built corpus, including n-grams, part of speech tags, dependency relations, scientific lexicon, and sentence splitting. SVM and NB were used as main classification methods, and they reported optimal results using SVM compared with NB. They stated that contextual polarity features did not work well on citation context and also reported that the best result was obtained by combining dependency relations and negation features. The author used micro-F and macro-F metrics, which are effective measurements to evaluate the performance of the text classification systems. The author managed to achieve micro-F 0.898 and macro-F 0.764. Although the proposed method achieves good results using such features in terms of macro-F, however, the main drawbacks of the proposed method are time-consuming for feature extraction and using small window size as citation context which ignores implicit citation. On the other hand, construction of features manually is a difficult and expensive process. To overcome these challenges, Athar and Teufel (2012a) built a citation corpus that includes explicit sentences and implicit citation. They assumed that the sentences around citation position hold important opinionated words that can help to improve the detection of author intent in citing works. They annotated 203,803 sentences into four classes, which are excluded sentences, positive, negative and objective sentences. Due to taking into account the implicit citation, they presented good results compared to using only explicit citation sentences. Although they tested their methods on suitable corpus size for classical machine learning methods such as SVM, however, they focused on computational linguistic papers as corpus of which make their work to be domain dependent.</p><p>Abu-Jbara et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) used a supervised sequence labeling technique for determining the citation context of a given reference, which contains the explicit citing sentence and the associated neighboring sentences to classify citation as positive or negative. The reference's style is different in the journals and can affect the extraction of the features. Therefore, they applied a regular expression to clean the citation context. They extracted four citation sentences as a window size and annotated by graduate students as a positive or negative citation. They used SVM with the features namely: reference count, verb, adjective, adverb, self-citation, negation, and dependency relations. They achieved an accuracy of 0.814 and macro-F 0.71.3. This work handles the challenge of citation context extraction by considering citing sentences that quote multiple articles. In addition, most of the proposed features are citation specific unlike other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jochim and Schutze 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kim and Thoma 2015)</ref>, which used known features such as POS tags and n-grams.</p><p>Parthasarathy and Tomar ( <ref type="formula">2014</ref>) used a sentence parser to extract citation sentences from the Google scholar database and identify adjectives that could be either positive or negative. According to them, if a sentence does not have an adjective, it can be either unknown or neutral. They employed various machine learning algorithms to detect citation sentiment. The main drawback of their work is using a few number of research papers (only 10 papers) as corpus. We know that the classification algorithms could be useful when large datasets are used to train and test the classifier. Also, they proposed only one feature (extracted adjectives) with supervised learning approaches to detect authors' sentiments, and used only explicit citation context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Sula and Miller (2014)</ref> designed a tool to identify citation sentences and detect sentiment in the humanities' publications. They utilized NB algorithm as the main method with ngrams model as features for citation classification. Four humanities journals were utilized to extract the citation sentences. They then labeled a few number of sentences as positive and some as negative in order to train NB classifier for identifying the citation polarity. They extracted citation context from humanity's articles unlike previous works, which focused on extraction of the citations from ACL Anthology. However, their tool failed to extract the citation sentences with multiple references, and was unable to identify implicit citation context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kim and Thoma (2015)</ref> proposed an approach to detect author's sentiment in the biomedical text documents. Their approach consists of: (1) classifying the papers as citing or cited papers, and (2) extracting citation sentences from the body of a research citing paper. They applied SVM with kernel function to identify the citation polarity with n-grams as a feature set. SVM with kernel was evaluated on 414 biomedical journals' titles. They classified author's sentiment as positive or others and their model performance was 0.90. They reported a good performance using supervised learning approach. However, they focused on extracting explicit citation, and ignored useful citations such as in discussion and results sections. Additionally, their work suffers from manual annotation process of citation context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Xu et al. (2015)</ref> focused on the discussion section of 285 clinical trial papers and developed a rule-based method to extract citation. In addition, more than 4000 citations were manually annotated by three annotators. Then, they used SVM with n-grams and sentiment lexicon as a feature set to classify the citation sentences into a positive or negative citation. The combination of their features achieved a better Micro F-score than individual features. Their work developed a good method for citation annotation but the annotation process is conducted manually. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Butt et al. (2015)</ref> proposed an approach to extract citation sentences with a window size of five sentences. Then the authors used NB as classification method to categorize the citation into positive and negative sentiment. They used a manual way to annotate the dataset. Their method achieved high classification results in terms of accuracy of 0.80. For citation context length, a large window size has been used and we believe that this size is ideal to carry authors' sentiments. Further, they used syntactic features but did not try to exploit semantic feature that is useful to represent the authors' sentiments.</p><p>Recently, Hernandez- <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Alvarez and Gomez (2015)</ref> developed annotation methodology for labeling citation sentences to be positive, negative or neutral in order to tackle the citation polarity classification. Keywords and semantic patterns are semantic features used to discriminate the polarity classes. They manually built a corpus and then utilized SVM for citation classification. They tested SVM on labeled corpus and achieved F1 of 0.92. Their work combined explicit and implicit citation to detect citation sentiment but it is domain dependent.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ma et al. (2016)</ref> addressed the polarity classification problem by exploiting an author's reputation information. They proposed to use different features, which include unigram, polarity distribution, author id, affiliation id, and p-index. They reported best classification performance through the combination of author id, affiliation Id, and p-index feature. Their work was the first investigation to improve traditional citation analysis method for assessing research quality. They shed the light on improving H-index method by including negative polarity in the calculation process. However, their work still needs feature engineering skills to use best features for citation sentiment detection.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> summarizes the methods that utilize machine learning to tackle SCSA problems. The first column depicts the reference information. The second column illustrates the level of analysis (document level or sentence level). The third presents the challenges that have been addressed by corresponding techniques. Techniques applied by authors are shown in the fourth column.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Other techniques</head><p>In this subsection, we review lexicon based approaches, deep learning, and keyword based method for handling citation sentiment detection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Sendhilkumar et al. (2013)</ref> used SentiWord-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Baccianella et al. 2010)</ref> to identify the citation sentiment with the aim of calculating article quality. They extracted sentences as citation context and applied POS tags to identify adjectives. They used the SentiWordNet Lexical Analyzer to score each adjective as positive or negative. Lastly, all adjective scores are aggregated to obtain overall sentiment of the sentences. Their work did not include implicit citation context and domain dependent. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Goodarzi et al. (2014)</ref> proposed a framework to identify author's polarity. They extracted citation context from digital library of medicine in PubMed, and then used Senti-WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Esuli and Sebastiani 2006)</ref> with other lexicons for polarity determination. Their results show the superiority of SentiWordNet compared with the other lexicons in the polarity determination task. On the other hand, few researchers have used deep learning method for performing citation polarity analysis. For example, Jochim and Schutze (2014) created an annotated corpus and made it publicly available for researchers and utilized a deep learning neural network for citation polarity classification. They adapted marginalized stacked de-noising auto encoders from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chen et al. (2012)</ref> and addressed the problem as a domain adaptation task. They trained the method on product review data and tested it with citation context. They achieved best Macro-F1 value of 0.549 compared to a product review domain.  <ref type="bibr">2013</ref>). However, they improved citation polarity classification by leveraging large amounts of annotated data from a product review domain by using a simple set of features. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Munkhdalai et al. (2016)</ref> proposed a neural attention model using a bi-directional long short-term memory algorithm with attention mechanism. Attention mechanism is used to assist neural network models to focus on most relevant input sequences rather than treating all word vectors equally. They tested their model on 5,000 citation sentences selected from PubMed<ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">foot_9</ref> and achieved F1-scores of 0.76. Their work used recent deep learning techniques and proposed a good model. However, their final results cannot be used for improving citation analysis methods because they focus on extracting only two citation sentences from each article. To improve citation analysis methods such as impact factor, the researchers should extract all the citing sentences from each article rather than two sentences only and include the negative citations in the calculation process to improve these methods.</p><p>Lastly, Kumar (2016) classified citation sentences into positive or negative by using the keyword-based method. The author utilized ACL Anthology corpus for extracting citation sentences. The author made a list of positive and negative keywords and depending on these lists the sentences are categorized as positive or negative. The author made a big citation corpus to test the rules but ignored expanding the window size of citation context. This work also used simple rules for citation sentiment classification, and designing such rules is a time-consuming problem.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows deep learning, lexicon based, and keyword techniques for SCSA.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Discussion</head><p>In this subsection, we present the analysis of SCSA techniques. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the distribution of the techniques, which are classified into four main categories. The most popular technique is machine learning, which normally depends on the correct selection of the features. Most of the researchers applied machine learning techniques specifically, supervised approaches such as SVM. However, there are no studies that explored unsupervised approaches.</p><p>Supervised machine learning approaches require large annotated dataset, and it is difficult to annotate citation context automatically due to its special characteristics. Manual annotation approach can be used for annotating citation context, and this approach could only be useful for limited number of examples. Distant supervision is another way to annotate large citation data. However, the manual approach can cause the issue of dataset quality of which can reduce the performance of the supervised approaches. Moreover, supervised approaches are domain specific which means training and testing a supervised approach in one domain can give good results. However, applying the same approach in another domain can affect the classification performance. The applications of supervised learning approaches have been identified to be incapable of finding and linking all related citation contexts. Therefore, well refined and developed natural language processing methods are needed for such purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Sugiyama et al. 2010)</ref>. In general, the citation contexts are often indirect and academically. Continuing efforts are needed to bring about a connection between sentiment expressions and technical terms for the sake of developing general sentiment lexicon in science. Another issue is that the existing approaches detect sentiment of citation context depending on different corpus size. Therefore, the comparison between the performances of these methods is difficult. Furthermore, the corpus annotation processes are made manually, and they use citation data from different domains. As a result, we believe that the availability of a large annotated corpus could be useful for machine learning techniques, especially supervised learning approaches. This can enable researchers to compare their works with the existing literature.</p><p>On the other hand, few studies used lexicon-based technique that depends on sentiment lexicons such as SentiWordNet and this technique does not need an annotated data. However, they depend on static lists of terms or words and assumed that the word that is not in the lexicon is not considered. One of the limitations of these approaches is content independent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related fields to SCSA</head><p>This section provides a review of the existing topics related to this study with a focus on citation classification and citation recommendation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Citation classification</head><p>Citation classification has been defined as the process of identifying the functions or purposes of quoting from other works <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Abu-Jbara et al. 2013)</ref>. In other words, it indicates the process of detecting the relationship between citing paper and cited paper. A number of researchers formulate this relationship as citation schemes or functions and proposed several schemes to identify the influence of cited papers on citing papers. For example, the oldest citation scheme was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Garfield (1965)</ref>, and suggested fifteen reasons that answer why researchers quote from preceding works. Another citation classification contains four dimensions which include conceptual or operational use, evolutionary or juxtaposition, organic or perfunctory and confirmative or negation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Moravcsik and Murugesan 1975)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Teufel et al. (1999)</ref> reported seven argumentative zones as another classification scheme, namely: background, other, own, aim, textual, contrast, and basis, according to the citation role in the author's argument. However, the above schemes have limitations related to a big number of functions, timeconsuming for citation annotation and cannot process big number of documents.</p><p>The automatic classification of citation functions can handle the schemes limitations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Nanba and Okumura (1999)</ref> used rule-based approach with cue words to reduce the citation functions into three categories, reference Type B, C, and O. Another classification of the citation was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Teufel et al. (2006)</ref>. They chose 116 articles in a random way from the computation and language E-print archive and classified twelve citation functions into four categories. They used POS tags, cue words, and n-grams as features with supervised approach. They test the model and obtained a macro-F of 0.57.</p><p>A supervised probabilistic model of classification with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) was employed to make a distinction between positive and negative polarity based on four corpora for sentiment detection in the Japanese language <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Nakagawa et al. 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Dong and SchÃ¤fer (2011)</ref> used a semi-supervised learning method, and NB classifier with features such as negation, cue words, POS-tag, location, and popularity. Their methods classified citations into the following: background, technical basis, fundamental idea and comparison. They tested their models using 120 papers from ACL Anthology and managed to achieve a macro-F of 0.66. Their work combines explicit and implicit citation for detecting reasons of citations.</p><p>Drawing upon the annotation scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Moravcsik and Murugesan (1975)</ref> and the Stanford maximum entropy classifier, Jochim and Schutze (2012) had four aspects scheme and a window size of 1, 2 and 3 sentences which captured the completeness and correctness of the cited work according to citing work. In their work, they used various features such as word level linguistic features, n-grams, sentence location, comparatives, and lexicon. The best result among the four dimensions is an F1measure of 0.682.</p><p>Based on the implementation of the hybrid method algorithm, Meyers ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) used discourse as their tree model and analyzed part of speech to find out citation relations regarding contrast and corroboration. The author utilized manually designed rules and lexical dictionary to build the hybrid algorithm. 20 papers were used to test the algorithm and classify citations into contrast or corroboration, and obtained recall values of 0.67 for contrasting articles and 0.83 for corroborating articles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Tsai et al. (2013)</ref> proposed an unsupervised bootstrapping algorithm which led to the categorization of two concepts: application and technique. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Xu et al. (2013)</ref> used SVM with linear kernel method and established a faceted classification of citation links in networks that are: functional, perfunctory, and ambiguous cases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Abu-Jbara et al. (2013)</ref> categorized the purpose and polarity of a citation context to different reasons. They employed SVM along with the trained classification model and linear kernel to the ACL Anthology <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Radev et al. 2009)</ref>. They used 30 papers as training data and 300 citations as development data to determine the best window size for citation classification. For citation classification, their SVM algorithm obtained a macro-F of 0.58. An alternative approach was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abdullatif et al. (2013)</ref> using a rule-based approach to automatically generate citation classification scheme. In their approach, citation sentences were tagged using the POS tagger and then semantic role labeling was used to select the exact verb that represents the citation sentence. These rules are tested using four test sets extracted from computer science field and their method obtained an accuracy of 0.75.</p><p>On the other hand, semantic technology is important to identify citation purpose. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ciancarini et al. (2013)</ref> employed CiTaLO instrument, CiTo2wordnet, and CiTo function for retrieving citation function. They made use of PDF formats and used many positive, negative, and neutral functions such as agree with, cites, cites as authority, cites as data source, cites as evidence, cites as metadata document, cites as potential solution, cites as recommended reading, cites as related, confirms, corrects, critiques, derides. Di <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Iorio et al. (2013)</ref> used a corpus including 18 articles to develop software called CiTaLo, by combining natural language processing techniques with an ontology learning and ontology mapping. They detected sentiment polarity of the citations using this software.</p><p>Recently, citation scheme has been created using clustering techniques. These techniques could be useful to address the annotation difficulty in previous schemes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abdullatif et al. (2015)</ref> proposed such approach that contains semantic and syntactic-based models. Their model employed multiple similarity methods to calculate the similarity between citation sentences. Each cluster of similar sentences is considered as a citation function.</p><p>Although a number of citation classification schemes have been proposed in the literature, most of these schemes have been developed manually and rely on a limited datasets. These issues have been investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdullatif (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abdullatif et al. (2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abdullatif et al. ( , 2015))</ref>. They selected each relevant verb in a citation sentence, and labeled citation sentences using semantic role labeling. Moreover, they proposed six rules to extract and choose the best verb that represents the citation sentence. Their rules were evaluated using four test sets and their results were reasonable.</p><p>In general, the performance of citation classification depends on the precise extraction of citation context from scientific documents. Currently, the results of existing approaches are not good (low values in terms of accuracy, precision and recall) because most of the proposed schemes and their training datasets are not sufficient for citation classification and the researchers cannot compare between the performances of their approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Citation recommendation</head><p>Citation recommendation is a method aiming to give a reference recommendation for an author when working on a particular paper. Thus, the main purpose of citation recommendation is to give the most suitable reference to the author's work. There are two major strands of works on citation recommendation. The first is the global citation recommendation that aims to suggest a list of references for an entire paper manuscript. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">McNee et al. (2002)</ref> used a partial list of reference as the input query and recommended additional references based on collaborative filtering. They used collaborative filtering to recommend research papers (citations) by marking citation graph between papers. They explored six methods for citation selection on off-line and online datasets. Four of them i.e. Co-Citation Matching, User-Item CF, Item-Item CF and NaÃ¯ve Bayesian classifier were collaborative filtering based and the other two i.e. Localized Citation graph Search and keyword search were non-collaborative filtering. These two algorithms use title and abstract of the target paper as additional information, which is not used by the collaborative filtering based algorithms.</p><p>In off-line experiments, graph search performed well for papers recommendation but it is biased towards often cited papers. Similarly, the User-Item and Item-Item algorithms also performed very well except at finding relevant citations. User-Item is considered good at novelty, whereas scoring Google, graph search and Bayesian were found least novel. Both good novelty and relevance scores make a good recommendation. Therefore, User-Item algorithm can be the best choice here, as it was the best at relevance in the off-line experiment and at novelty in the online experiment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Strohman et al. (2007)</ref> supposed that the input is an incomplete manuscript and recommended articles based on text similarity using bibliography similarity and Katz centrality measurements. They assumed that a user has written something about the topic in their document (later that should be used as query). They used graph based features instead of simple similarities to achieve better results. They proposed a model which search for the relevant documents and then ranked them by using features. The features they listed, also need to be further investigated for ranking the list. They proposed that text-based or citation based features alone are not enough for ranking the documents. For features weights, they combined the features in a weighted linear model, but they did not present the mathematical notion of that relation.</p><p>Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bethard and Jurafsky (2010)</ref> added more features such as topical similarity, author's behavioral patterns, and citation count to train a classifier for global recommendation. Many new features were added like author's impact, author's citation habits, topic similarity and citing topic entropy. They also added some features from related work like citation count, publication age and citing terms. Their proposed system outperforms state of the art term-similarity baseline methods.</p><p>Topic modeling based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kataria et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Nallapati et al. 2008)</ref> were proposed to recommend articles that are topically similar to the input query. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Nallapati et al. (2008)</ref> presented two novel topic models i.e. Pairwise Link-LDA and Link-PLSA-LDA for joint modeling of links and text. They are of the opinion that Link-PLSA-LDA outperforms Pairwise Link-LDA on both log-likelihood and link prediction. Although Link-PLSA-LDA performs better in performance and scalability, Pairwise Link-LDA is still very handy for semantics handling. It is useful in capturing the links. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kataria et al. (2010)</ref> extended the Link-PLSA-LDA approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Nallapati et al. (2008)</ref> and proposed cite-PLSA-LDA. It is a generative process that uses context information of citations in documents. The model is also used in finding association between citation context and cited document.</p><p>The second feature is based on local citation recommendation. In the local approach, the input query is a particular context wherein a citation could be made. The context often consists of one to three sentences. Thus the local recommendation aims to recommend a short list of articles that need to be cited within the given context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Tang and Zhang (2009)</ref> suggested to use restricted Boltzmann machine to recommend citations based on candidate citation contexts. Their model learns a mixture of topic distributions over articles contents and citation relationships. The proposed model ranks papers for a given citation context, and recommends the top ranked papers. The model also finds relationship between the recommended papers and the citation sentences. The authors compared their results with baseline methods and set some parameters for the evaluated methods without justifying their values. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">He et al. (2010)</ref> supposed that a user has already given placeholders for citation in a query manuscript. In their work, a probabilistic model was trained to measure the similarity between the citation contexts and the cited papers. Their model is context aware, where context is extracted from the text near the placeholder. They believe that the model can recommend a ranking list of citations/set of citations for a context with high quality and scalable.</p><p>In another work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">He et al. (2011)</ref>, they first divided the document into a sequence of disjoint candidate citation contexts, and then applied the dependency feature model to extract a ranked list of articles for each context. Machine translation methods were used to find out the relation between citation contexts and cited documents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Huang et al. (2012)</ref> proposed neural language model that used local and global document contexts for better semantic word representations. These representations can be used to represent contexts for grouping word instances which are used in multi-prototype version of the model i.e. used for words with multiple senses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lu et al. (2011)</ref> made use of the translation model to bridge the gap between citation context and article's content. Since the citations context and the contents of the articles vary widely, the model can bridge the gap between them. They used articles, citation placeholder and the corresponding citation context of each article in their corpus. They argued that combining more useful features like other citations in the paper, and global content of the paper can improve the recommendation. multilingual and multimodal contents are encountered when handling SA on all types of textual data. In the following, we present the possible future works.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further research on citation context extraction and annotation</head><p>Most of the citation extraction methods focus only on extracting explicit citation context. More attention is needed to identify the implicit citation context. Citation handling would prove to be useful in correcting the inaccurate parse trees. We believe that accurate natural language processing methods could be helpful to extract the citation context. Besides, choosing the best window size (preferably three sentences as citation context) could be suitable to convey the authors' sentiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Alvarez and GÃ³mez 2014)</ref>. The citation labeling process is conducted manually in SCSA. Therefore, semi-automatic methods such as extracting important keywords and using semantic role labeling techniques may be better and less timeconsuming for citation annotation. For example, one of these methods is applied successfully in citation purpose classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Abdullatif et al. 2015)</ref> and the researchers can adapt this method in SCSA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further research on citation classification and citation recommendation</head><p>The main drawback in citation classification is the lack of standard classification scheme for identifying the purpose of citations. Moreover, the annotation schemes are different and the researchers cannot compare their results and these schemes were annotated manually and domain specific. Another challenge is the complex process of manual feature extraction. Therefore, it requires building standard dataset to help researchers compare the performance of their methods. Developing and applying domain independent techniques and feature engineering can lead to improved classification results.</p><p>By going through the literature of citation recommendations, we come up with the observations that many researchers use partial list of references in their work to predict citations, yet some others focused on paper contents as well. Also, some researchers involved authors' behaviors along with citation habits and citation counts. One of the main drawbacks observed is lacking in capturing the contexts of the citations to find the relevance between context and cited documents. Therefore, NLP techniques should be applied to capture the context in a better way. Further, extracting semantic features from implicit and explicit citation may help citation recommendation process.</p><p>Further research on improving the SCSA model performance On the use of unsupervised machine learning methods, the majority of studies for solving SCSA issues have used supervised machine learning approaches such as SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Abu-Jbara et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Athar 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hernandez-Alvarez and Gomez 2015)</ref>. However, these approaches have some limitations; feature selection process is one of the most important problems that have been used to train the classifiers. The performance of the classifier depends on the correct selection of the features. Therefore, unsupervised approaches seem to be useful to address some of SCSA challenges. For example, distribution representation methods such as word2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Mikolov et al. 2013</ref>) and dependency-based word embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Wang et al. 2016)</ref> can handle the manual feature extraction in the previous SCSA literature. These methods can capture syntactic and semantic structure of citation context.</p><p>On the use of hybrid methods, another interesting trend is on the combination of machine learning and lexicon based methods. It can improve the classification performance as can be observed in other SA domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mudinas et al. 2012)</ref>. We believe that hybrid methods could be an effective solution to address the limitations of the machine learning and lexicon based methods. For example, such solution could be use neural network models as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Mikolov et al. (2013)</ref> for feature representation. This can handle the manual process of feature selection with ensemble learning approach. In addition, the hybridization of learning representation methods could be useful to improve the accuracy and quality of SCSA. For example, the combination of recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism for feature representation and then using supervised learning approach to perform citation polarity classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bing and Yang 2017)</ref>.</p><p>On the use of deep learning, one of the most important limitations of machine-learning approaches is that their effectiveness depends on the set of selected features. However, typical feature selection approaches cannot address some phenomena, such as negation detection. One solution to address this is the using of algorithms that are capable of learning representations of the data known as deep-learning algorithms. The effectiveness of these algorithms on SCSA is still under-explored since there are only two studies that used deep learning method for polarity classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jochim and Schutze 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Munkhdalai et al. 2016)</ref>. One of the interesting directions could be to examine the effectiveness of the recursive neural network deep-learning algorithms on SCSA and negation handling in the citation since they are effective on SA of standard text. Moreover, Since SA is a very semantic topic; machine learning models can be supported and improved by existing semantic resources such as WordNet-Affect and SenticNet4 lexicons <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Strapparava and Valitutti 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cambria et al. 2016)</ref> . The combination of linguistic knowledge derived from sentiment lexicons with deep learning models could be useful for improving citation polarity classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ebert 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>Recent years have seen growing research interest in analyzing the content of academic publications, specifically the citation context. Mining authors' thoughts or sentiments in a large number of publications for different topics published every day in academic libraries is useful for improving citation analysis methods by considering the negative weight in its scheme.</p><p>Machine-learning techniques have been used for solving SCSA issues more than other techniques such as lexicon-based techniques. The SVM and NB classifiers have been the most frequently methods used for performing SCSA. Different kinds of features have been utilized with machine learning classifiers. One of the popular features is unigram which is a fundamental feature, and normally, researchers have used this feature as a baseline method for comparison purposes. Furthermore, researchers applied lexicon-based methods such as SentiWordNet to find terms that reveal sentiment and then classified the citation context into polarity levels. Deep learning methods have also been used to address the problem of feature selection in SCSA.</p><p>Our review provided an overview of the current SCSA methods. Most of the recent articles in SCSA field were classified and briefly explained. Following the analysis, it is quite obvious that SCSA is still an under-researched area. We examined the most prominent techniques for SCSA and reviewed common techniques to classify citation function and for citation recommendation. In addition, research resources that have been used in SCSA are also provided. Our survey offers an in-depth analysis of the current SCSA techniques, reviews several other trends, reveals interesting open issues, and highlights encouraging upcoming research directions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2 Illustration of normal process of SCSA</figDesc></figure>
